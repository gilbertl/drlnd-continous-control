## Project Environment 

The Jupyter notebook in this repository trains an agent to move a double-jointed arm to target locations.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm.

Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

## Instructions

1. Follow the instructions in the [DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up the Python experiment.

2. Install a customized unity environment
